# Market-research-on-Tesla
Produced a market research proposal for a client brief given by Tesla. 
The market research proposal aims to achieve sustainable growth for Tesla by fulfilling their business objectives. The research focuses on understanding driver attitudes, brand perceptions, consumer appetites, and evolving trends in the electric vehicle industry. 

A clear and concise method of carrying out the research is proposed, with different techniques such as Factor Analysis and ANOVA for analyzing data from Tesla and non-Tesla customers. The proposal also outlines limitations and potential for future research, along with questionnaires for both customer groups.
